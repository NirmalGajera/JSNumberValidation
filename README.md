# JSNumberValidation
**Description:**

This update expands the functionality and verification of the `isNumeric` function by implementing a comprehensive suite of 100 test cases. The test cases are designed to rigorously evaluate the function across a wide variety of possible inputs, ensuring robust and accurate detection of numeric values.

**Key changes include:**

- **Functionality:**
  - Improved `isNumeric` function to correctly identify numbers expressed in various formats, including:
    - Standard integers and floating-point numbers.
    - Negative numbers.
    - Scientific notation (e.g., `3e2`).
    - Hexadecimal numbers (e.g., `0x1`).
  - Ensured that non-numeric, malformed, or incorrectly structured numeric strings return `false`.

- **Test Suite:**
  - **100 Test Cases**: Encompasses diverse scenarios covering positive numeric checks, negative cases for typical non-numeric inputs, malformed strings, and edge cases specific to JavaScript (like large/small integers).
  - **Automated Testing**: Utilizes assertions to validate that the `isNumeric` function returns expected results for each test case.
  - **Edge and Boundary Conditions**: Includes checks for edge cases such as maximum safe integers, small decimals, input with leading/trailing spaces, and malformed scientific notation.
